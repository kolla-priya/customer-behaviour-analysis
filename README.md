# Customer Behaviour Analysis

This project explores how customers shop and what influences their decisions.  
I used Python, SQL, and Power BI to understand different patterns in the data, create visual insights, 
and build a simple dashboard to highlight the key findings.

The goal of this project is to see:
- Who our most valuable customers are
- How factors like discounts, reviews, and shipping preferences impact spending
- Which products perform well
- How subscriber behaviour differs from non-subscribers
- What actions a business can take to increase loyalty and repeat purchases
